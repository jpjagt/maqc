        We are MADE MSc students at AMS Institute in Amsterdam. In collaboration
        with the MIT Senseable City Lab, we did a research project, which
        focused on using low-cost sensors called City Scanners to measure air
        quality around construction sites. However, we encountered a number of
        practical hurdles that made it difficult to produce reliable results. As
        a result, we have created a guideline for other professionals and
        researchers who want to conduct similar experiments in the future,
        outlining the challenges we faced and offering suggestions for how to
        overcome them.
