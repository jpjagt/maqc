              We are MADE MSc students at AMS Institute in Amsterdam. In
              collaboration with the MIT Senseable City Lab, we did a research
              project, which focused on using low-cost sensors called City
              Scanners to measure air quality around construction sites.
              However, we encountered a number of practical hurdles that made it
              difficult to produce reliable results. As a result, we have
              created a guideline for other professionals and researchers who
              want to conduct similar experiments in the future, outlining the
              challenges we faced and offering suggestions for how to overcome
              them.

            “Meten is weten” (To measure is to know)
          </h3>

          <p class="mb-9">
            Construction companies are increasingly aware of their social
            responsibility as well as economic incentives to minimize
            pollutants. However, prioritizing interventions when investment
            costs are high can be difficult. Implementing low-cost sensors
            on-site or on your machinery could inform sustainable investment
            decisions.

          <h3 class="text-xl mb-3 text-primary">Healthy work environment</h3>

          <p class="mb-9">
            Creating a healthy work environment for construction workers is
            important. Measuring on-site, and especially on-person, allows
            workers to measure their direct exposure to pollutants. This
            information can be used to improve the working conditions.

            Competitive advantage in tenders
          </h3>

          <p>
            There is increasing attention to sustainability measurements in the
            construction sector from the government and the media. Therefore, if
            you can demonstrate that you apply sustainable building practices,
            it will give you a comparative advantage over other contractors in
            tender processes.
